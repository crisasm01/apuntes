# Introduccion
## Inteligencia Artificial
Study of computational models that allow machines to perceive, reason and act with great flexibility

## Machine Learning
Any computer program that improves its performance at some task through experience

There are 3 main ingredients:
1. Representation
2. Performance
3. Optimization

### ML Problem
$$f* = arg min_{f \in H} L(f(x)) $$

Aproximated as

$$f*_{Tr} = arg min_{f \in H} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{x_i \in Tr}^N L(f(x_i))$$
